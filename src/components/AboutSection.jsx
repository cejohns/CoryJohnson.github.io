        Hi, I'm Cory Evan Johnson — a passionate software developer based in Goldsboro, NC. I’ve been developing software for over eight years, working across a range of technologies including C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript. My experience spans everything from modern web frameworks and databases to game engines and desktop apps.

I'm also the developer behind South Star Game Studios, where I combine my love for gaming and tech to build creative and engaging experiences. Whether I'm designing tools, building web applications, or working on a new game, I’m always driven by the challenge of solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code.
